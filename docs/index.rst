Baudot – A 5-bit Stateful Codec
===============================

Baudot is a Python library for encoding and decoding 5-bit stateful encoding.

This library is named after `Jean-Maurice-Émile Baudot`_ (1845-1903), the French
engineer who invented this code. The `Baudot code`_ was the first practical and
widely used binary character encoding, and is an ancestor of the ASCII code we
are familiar with today.
